    info: `Located next to Manhattan in Long Island City, Doug Holt Photography Studios was established as a New York City photo studio 17 yrs ago.  He enjoys 1000 square feet of open workspace and constant daylight.

    Shooting jewelry in a common production at my photo studio.  I love shooting collections on Models, and I love to take the time and care required to do jewelry still life and product shots well. In this digital age, every piece of jewelry I photograph goes through a thorough color balance process, silhouetting from background and intense digital retouching for amazing final image result.

    The Studio is well-equipped with huge 13ft seamless and painted Canvas backgrounds.  The studio bustles with Commercial Look Book, Catalog, Sales Sheet,  E Commerce shoots.  We produce a lot of Highly Creative Editorial Social Media campaigns for placement on Instagram and Facebook as well as International Print Advertisement Campaigns.`,

    info: `My Studio is located next to Manhattan in Long Island City and was established 17 years ago.  While I greatly enjoy shooting product and fashion - I've been shooting interiors and architecture since the beginning.  My longest apprenticeship was with the storied New York interior photographer Peter Margonelli.  I'll proudly admit that I was greatly influenced by his careful use of strobes blended with natural light, as well as incorporating so many profound decisions he regularly made regarding his approach to shooting interiors have stuck with me.  "Always allow the eye to walk through the room, and end of somewhere beautiful".  A great line, and so true.

    Digital retouching of Interior and Architectural images is no simple thing, which is why I work at the same terminal as my retoucher on all interior shoots.

    My studio is well-equipped with huge 13ft seamless and painted Canvas backgrounds, surfaces and sweeps to shoot Table Top on.  The studio bustles with Commercial Look Book, Catalog, Sales Sheet,  E Commerce shoots.  We also produce a lot of Highly Creative Editorial Social Media campaigns for placement on Instagram and Facebook as well as International Print Advertisement Campaigns.`,

    text: `A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
      <br><br> I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream.
      <br><br> I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes.
